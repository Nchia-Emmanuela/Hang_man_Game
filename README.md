# Hang_man_Game
## Description
    This is a simple guessing game written in python.
    To play the game, you just guess a letter, by typing it on your keyboard.
    if your guess is correct, it allows you to keep guessing.
    and if you get the word correctly, you win
    But if your guess is wrong for the first time, it gives you another try until you exhaust your life then you lose
    example the word could be bill, and you guess four times all wrong you lose.
